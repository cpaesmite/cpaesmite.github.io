<p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Everyone wants to innovate more, and many people don’t know where to start. Which is weird, since we actually know quite a bit about how innovation works.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is a list of some of things that we know are true:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Solutions come from empowered people. Delegate decision making as far towards the front line as you can to increase your innovation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. You can’t legislate innovation. It doesn’t work to just say to people “go innovate” – your business model needs to support it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3. It’s not just about ideas. It’s the process of idea management.</p>
<p> </p>



<p> </p>
<p>4. Innovation is the best way to bridge a gap between where you are and where you want to be.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5. Getting the great idea to spread is just as important as having it and making it work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>6. If every idea you try works you’re not trying enough new ideas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>7. Make lots of little bets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>8. People are way more important than tools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>9. Innovations can be good or bad – make sure you’re creating real value.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>10. You need a deep understanding of the problem you’re trying to solve.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>11. Ask new questions. Make new mistakes. Learn.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>12. A problem in need of a solution is worth lots more than a solution looking for a problem.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>13. Anyone can innovate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>14. Connecting ideas is the fundamental creative act in innovation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>15. You need top-down commitment to create a culture of innovation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>16. If you don’t have the support of your manager, you need to innovate by stealth – how much can you get away with?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>17. Efficiency is often the enemy of innovation – you need slack!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>18. Failing is good – try to fail as small as possible, and make sure you learn from it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>19. Innovation needs to support strategy, but every once in a while it can create it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>20. Innovation works best when you pursue a portfolio of innovative projects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Innovation is not a black box. If you apply some of these ideas, you can make your organisation more effective at innovating.</p>
