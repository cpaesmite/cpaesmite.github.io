<p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Merchandise trade declines across most major economies in first quarter of 2014</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Total merchandise exports of the G7 and BRICS economies combined fell 2.7% in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the previous quarter (seasonally adjusted figures in current US dollars). Imports stagnated with only 0.1% growth over the same period (mainly due to continued imports of crude oil and fuels). </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Exports fell sharply in China (by 7.3%) which may partly reflect the Chinese New Year but also the impact of a government crack-down on over-invoicing; imports fell more moderately (by 0.9%). In Japan, the recent import boom in the run up to the consumption tax hike in April seems to have dissipated, with imports rising by only 0.9%, while exports slowed sharply (by 3.5%). Overall this resulted in a record high trade deficit of 44.8 billion USD.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the United States, exports fell by 1.3%, while imports increased by 0.8%. Canada witnessed the sharpest quarterly decrease in exports (2.9%) and imports (3.3%) since 2009. Merchandise trade also declined substantially in the United Kingdom (3.2% for imports and 4.3% for exports).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Among the G7 and BRICS countries, only Germany and Italy registered an increase in merchandise exports of 2.1% and 1.5%, respectively. Exports and imports were mainly flat in France.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>In other BRICS countries merchandise trade also contracted. In Brazil, exports declined 5.8% and imports increased by 1.9% while in Russia exports and imports declined by 2.9% and 2.8% respectively. India also witnessed a decrease in trade (3.0% for exports and 0.9% for imports), as did South Africa (4.3% for exports and 1.5% for imports).</p>
